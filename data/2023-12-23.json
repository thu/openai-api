It is also the least populated. It is named after the Yukon River and its capital and largest city is Whitehorse. Yukon's economy is based on mining and tourism. The territory is known for its stunning natural beauty, with numerous national parks, mountains, and wildlife. It also has a rich indigenous culture and history."}, {"role": "mankind", "time": "17:56:47", "message": "Give me a detailed plan of Whitehorse please"}, {"role": "machine", "time": "17:57:04", "message": "As an AI developed by OpenAI, I don't have the ability to provide a visual or detailed layout map of the city of Whitehorse. However, I can provide an informational description.\n\nWhitehorse, the capital of Canada's Yukon territory, is nestled on the banks of the Yukon River. The layout of the city is mainly determined by the natural geography including mountains, plateaus, rivers, and forests.\n\n1. Central Whitehorse: This area includes the downtown region, referred to as \"Main Street\". It is the city's business core with stores, restaurant, offices, and historical sites like the Old Log Church.\n\n2. The Riverdale Region: Located to the southeast, across the Yukon River from downtown Whitehorse, this is primarily a residential community.\n\n3. Marwell/Industrial Area: This sits to the west of downtown Whitehorse and is predominantly an industrial and commercial region.\n\n4. Takhini Hillcrest: Located on the west side of the city that is a combination of residential, retail, and educational sites.\n\n5. Porter Creek: A predominantly residential area on the high slopes to the northwest.\n\n6. Copper Ridge, Granger, and Logan: These newly developed residential areas are West of the airport.\n\n7. Yukon River: A notable feature cutting through the city, offering river trails and boating activities.\n\n8. The Canada Games Centre: A multi-purpose community sport, recreation, and wellness facility located in the city's centre.\n\n9. Whitehorse Airport: Just west of the city centre, it provides domestic, international, and local flights.\n\n10. Yukon Wildlife Preserve: Located approximately 30 minutes from downtown, this wildlife preserve is a popular destination.\n\n11. Schwatka Lake: A stunning lake located just south of downtown Whitehorse, accessible via recreational trail systems.\n\nFor a more detailed plan or map of Whitehorse, I recommend using online mapping systems such as Google Maps or visiting the city's official website. Please note that Whitehorse has also many green spaces, bike and pedestrian friendly trails which make it a great city for outdoor activities."}, {"role": "mankind", "time": "17:57:43", "message": "什么是一键三连？"}, {"role": "machine", "time": "17:57:48", "message": "\"一键三连\"是中国网络用语，常用于视频网站，指的是观看视频时快速进行\"点赞\"、\"收藏\"和\"分享\"三个操作。该词最初来源于B站(bilibili)，后来在各大平台广泛传播开来。"}]
